My name is Carla Braga A.K.A TekhneDev. I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil, currently living in Brasília! I'm working mostly with TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, and... Well, basically anything techy you put in front of me! 

I truly love programming, especially Open-Source. I'm a developer since 2022, when I was in college. Now I have degrees in computer science and systems analysis and development, and I am currently pursuing a degree in mechatronics engineering.
